Implement a system to represent meals made of individual components. 
Define an abstract class MealComponent with a String name and two abstract methods: 
double getCalories() and double getPrice().
Implement a class Ingredient that extends MealComponent and has fixed calorie 
and price values provided in its constructor.
Implement a class Meal that also extends MealComponent, 
but represents a composite component. 
It must store multiple MealComponent objects in an ArrayList. 
Its getCalories() method must return the total calories of all components, 
and its getPrice() method must return the total price of all components. 
Provide a method addComponent(MealComponent c) to add items to the meal.
Finally, write a TestMeal class with a main method that creates several ingredients, 
creates a meal composed of multiple ingredients (and potentially sub-meals), 
and prints the meal’s name, total calories, and total price.
