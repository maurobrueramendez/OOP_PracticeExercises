Implement a system to represent items in a small library. 
Define an interface LibraryItem with methods String getTitle() and double getValue(). 
Implement two item types: Book, which has a title, an author, and a price; 
and Magazine, which has a title, an issue number, and a price. 
Implement a class LibraryCollection that stores multiple LibraryItem objects in an ArrayList, 
allows adding new items, and provides a method printInventory() that prints all items using their toString(). 
Implement toString() in both Book and Magazine so the output includes all relevant information. 
Finally, write a TestLibrary class with a main method that creates several books and magazines, 
adds them to a collection, and prints the full inventory.
