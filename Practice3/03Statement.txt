Implement a generic storage system. 
Define a generic interface Storage<T> with methods void add(T element), 
ArrayList<T> getElements(), and void clear(). 
Implement a class BasicStorage<T> that stores elements in an ArrayList<T> 
and implements all interface methods. 
Then implement a class LoggingStorage<T> that also implements Storage<T> 
and internally uses a BasicStorage<T> object to store the elements, 
but additionally counts how many times add, getElements, and clear are called. 
Provide a method void printStatistics() in LoggingStorage<T> that prints these counts. 
Finally, write a TestStorage class with a main method that creates 
a LoggingStorage<String>, adds some strings, retrieves elements, clears them, 
and prints the statistics.
