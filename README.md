This is a collection of **code-based problems** and their implementations, in preparation for the final exam of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course.

In each exercise folder you will find at the very top the .txt file named *XXStatement* where *XX* will correspond to the index of the exercise.

Read the statements, try to implement the asked code, and try to compile and execute.

Each folder will contain the implementation of each exercise, with which you can compare, understand, and prepare for such exercises.

-**Good luck**!-
